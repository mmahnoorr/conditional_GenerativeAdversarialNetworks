# conditional_GenerativeAdversarialNetworks

Brain Image Synthesis using Conditional GANs (Pix2Pix)
This repository implements a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) based on the Pix2Pix architecture for brain image synthesis. The framework is designed to generate realistic synthetic brain images from paired masks and labels (e.g., healthy brain masks and lesion masks). The model enables both training and inference workflows, with support for generating new, unseen cases by combining white matter masks from healthy subjects with lesion masks from abnormal subjects.

The workflow is intended for medical image augmentation, synthesis, and classifier training, especially in scenarios where labeled data is limited.
